    <h3 class="section-title">REAL TIME PROJECT: AUTOMATIC CALL NOTIFICATION</h3>
    <p>The objective of the project is the Automatic Call Notification project aims to send a message automatically when someone is unable to answer a call, without relying on mobile devices. This is useful in situations like:
- Busy or emergency situations where answering calls isn't possible. 
- Offices or workplaces with landline phones.
- Situations where mobile phones are not allowed or are out of reach.
The system would detect when a call is missed or unanswered and trigger an automated message to the caller, providing an alternative contact method or a custom message.
Some possible technologies to achieve this include: - Computer-Telephony Integration (CTI) - Interactive Voice Response (IVR) systems - Cloud-based telephony platforms like Twilio or Nexmo - Integration with existing PBX or phone systems.
